h1. easy-vimeo

easy-vimeo aims to be a very easy and Ruby wrapper around the Vimeo API.

With easy-vimeo, you can upload a video file to the Vimeo website and set its basic properties in a few lines of code.

h1. What's new ?

0.3.0 : updates to new Ruby Vimeo API with some cleanup. We don't need curl anymore because the Ruby Vimeo API now uses HTTPClient to upload.

h1. Example

h2. Send a video in just a few lines of code...

<pre>
<code>
  v = Vimeo::Easy.new :api_key => VIMEO_API_KEY, :secret_key => VIMEO_SECRET_KEY, :auth_token => VIMEO_AUTH_TOKEN
  v.title = "Ma great video"
  v.description = "Great cool video"
  v.tags = "youpi, super, cool"
  v.privacy = :anybody
  
  v.file = "/Users/nicolas/test.mov"
  v.save
</code>
</pre>

h2. Or just get the attributes from an existing video...

<pre>
<code>
  v = Vimeo::Easy.find 2052244, :api_key => VIMEO_API_KEY, :secret_key => VIMEO_SECRET_KEY
</code>
</pre>
  
h2. Other interesting methods...

<pre>
<code>
  v.available? # => returns true if the video is currenly available on Vimeo (uploaded & transcoded)
  v.destroy    # => destroy the video
  v.reload     # => reload the attributes
</code>
</pre>

h1. TODO

Add some error management.

And that's all for now ;). Thanks!
